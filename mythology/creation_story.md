# The Story of the Creation of Everything

This story had been passed down as an Oral Tradition for many generations. The great bard Farthyer wrote down the tradition in Common so that all could know how things came to be.

## Darkness and the Beginning

In the beginning, there was Darkness. The Darkness wrapped itself around and as it wrapped, it tangled and knotted. The knots and tangles knotted and tangled themselves and slowly, a being formed. This being, the first thing, was called Ith.

Ith became from Darkness, and from Darkness, Ith came to be.

The Darkness was very tangled and knotted, and Ith thought that this was not good, so Ith took the Darkness and untied the knots and straightened the tangles. After twelve days, Ith has straightened the Darkness, and so the Darkness was at it had been before Ith. Ith thought that should the Darkness tangle itself again, it would take twelve more days to straighten. Ith decided to count the days by twelve, so Ith would know how much longer it would take to untangle the Darkness, but Ith did not want to count alone, as it would take time to mark the days and therefore add time needed to straighten the Darkness, so Ith decided to let the Darkness be and see what woud happen. As before, the darkness wrapped itself around and tangled and knotted. The knots and tangles tangled and knotted, and another being formed. This being, the second thing, was called Ool.

Ool became from Darkness, and from Darkness, Ool came to be.

Ool and Ith began to straighten the Darkness. Ith would straighten and Ool would count. After 12 days, the Darkness was again as it was, and Ith and Ool were happy. Satisfied with their work, Ith and Ool set off to see what there was to see. But they could not see far as Darkness enveloped everything, so Ith and Ool decided to make something to help see. Ith took many parts of the Darkness, held them close, and threw them out, creating the stars. Ool found a large knot of Darkess, breathed on it, and made the Sun, Io. Io shined brighter than all the stars together, but as Ith, Ool, and Io walked, Io grew tired, and needed to rest. As Io rested, the light from Io turned to darkness, and the stars were the only light. Ith and Ool decided that this could not be, as they could not see far enough with the light from the stars, so Ith found another knot of Darkness, breathed on it, and made the Moon, Oi. Oi was smaller than Io, but was still brighter than the stars, so as Io rested, Oi shined. Ith and Ool thought that Io and Oi might fight, as Io might say "I was created by Ool, I was fashioned from the bigger knot, you must listen to me", and Oi might say "I was created by Ith, and I was created because of you. As you rested, I was created, so you must listen to me". Ith and Ool decided that it would be best if Io and Oi never met so that they could not fight, and so as Io rested, Oi lit the way. And as Oi rested, Io lit the way. And it was good.

After 12 days had been counted 3 times, Ith and Ool decided to return to where they had come from, as surely the Darkness must have knotted and tangled. They returned with Io and Oi, and found a knot had been formed. This knot was larger than the knot Oi was formed from. It was larger than the knot that Io was formed from. It was larger than the knots that formed Ool and the knots that formed Ith. But nothing had come from this knot. Ith turned to Ool and said "I had come from knots, you had come from knots, surely something must have come from this knot". So Ith took Oi and set off around the knot to see what had come from the knot. Once Ith and Oi were gone for half a day, Ool and Io set off as well to see if they too could find what had come from the knot. For 12 days, Ith and Ool walked around the knot to find what had come from it. After 12 days, Ith and Ool could not find what had come from the knot. So Ith and Ool took the knot, and it was heavy. With all the strength they had, they lifted the knot. With all the breath they had, they breathed on the knot, and with all they had come to know, they gave to the knot. And the knot became Tilo, and Ith and Ool disappeared.

Tilo became from Ith and Ool, and from Ith and Ool, Tilo came to be.

## Io, Oi, and Tilo

Tilo awoke already with the knowledge of Ith and Ool. Tilo looked at Io and Oi, embrased them, and said "My friends, I am here". And they were glad.

Io looked to Oi and said "Who are you? You shine like I do, and rest like I do. Are you me?" Similarly, Oi looked to Io and said "Who are you? We shine together, and I feel I've known you, but we have never met"

Tilo looked to Io and Oi and said "Io, you were fashioned from the darkness to light the way. Oi, you were fashioned from the darkness to light the way. As one of you rests, the other looks on. As the other looks on, one of you can rest. You are together and seperate. Different and the same." Io and Oi pondered what Tilo had said to them, then Io turned to Oi and said "I will shine bright for you, and the time that I shine bright, you may rest". Oi smiled, looked to Io and said "I am not as bright at you, but I will shine as you do while you rest. We will light the way for Tilo". Tilo smiled, and said "As you shine, you will light my way" and they were happy, and it was good.

## Tilo Creates Day and Night

Tilo decided that Io and Oi should be on opposite sides of Tilo, so that as one lit the way, the other could rest without being bothered by the light. When it was time for Io and Oi to change places, the stars would come to help show them where they should be. The stars could not come too close, as the light from Io and Oi would be too bright for them. But they still helped.

## Tilo Creates the Land and the Seas

Tilo decided that they were dressed very plainly. Tilo looked at Io and thought "Io shines so bright, they are dazzling". Tilo looked at Oi and thought "Oi shines very cool, but there is beauty to Oi's shine. The stars can shine with Oi very easily, they are dazzling together".

So Tilo took some of the Darkness and stretched it very finely. Then, Tilo took the very finely stretched Darkness and weaved it into a cloth. This cloth was like the Darkness when Oi shined on it. "Oh!" Exclaimed Oi, "I see myself in your cloth! I see the stars, and we shimmer," and Tilo was happy. Then, as Io took position, the light was brighter, and the cloth became many shades of blue. "Oh!" Exclaimed Io, "I see myself in the cloth, but the cloth is so blue! It has many shades." And so, the places that Tilo had covered in cloth became the sea, and the places that had not became the land.

## The Creation of Life

Tilo spent many days and nights looking out into the darkness. Tilo talked with Io and Oi, and Tilo talked with the stars, and Tilo was happy. One night, Tilo had a dream. In this dream, Tilo saw things that had never been before. Tilo asked them, "Who are you?" But they did not respond. These creatures simply looked to Tilo and smiled.

When Tilo awoke, they told Io and Oi what they had seen. Io thought, then said "Everything from the Darkness can speak. If these creatures cannot speak, maybe they are not from the Darkness?" Oi agreed. So Tilo took some of the water from the seas and gave it to Io. Io took the water, breathed on it, and gave it back to Tilo. Tilo put it to the land and the water turned to grass and wheat. But this what not what Tilo had seen. Oi took some of the grass and stretch it, and created trees. But this was not what Tilo had seen. Tilo took a tree, and planted it on a mountain. The tree, in the cold, became harder and harder, and reached as high as it could to the heat of Io. Finally, the tree could not reach any farther, so it uprooted itself and climed the mountain to be closer to Io. This was the first Ent. But this was not what Tilo had seen.

Tilo, Io, and Oi approached the ent and asked it "Who are you?" The ent said nothing, it did not know how to speak. Io said "we could teach it to speak" and so for many days Tilo, Io, and Oi taught the ent to speak. Finally, on the 48th day, the ent said "I am Thres, I was nothing, and now I am here, and you have made me." Tilo said "We have made you, and you can make more. As the seedlings from trees plant themselves in the dirt, so too will your children," and Thres understood. Thres climed to the mountain where Thres was first planted, and planted the seedlings, and many days later, the first children of Thres came forth. As they grew, they traveled and nurtured the forests and planted the trees and more seedlings.

Tilo, Io, and Oi said "we can create, and teach them, so we shall," and they set off. Taking hard stone, Io baked the stone with thier heat, and made the first Dragons. The Dragons were many colors from the stone that they were first made from. They were taught to speak, and they took to the mountains in pairs of same color. Oi took clouds from the sky, dirt from the forsts, heat from Io, and water from the shallow seas. These were taken by Oi to the stars and brought back. These were the first elementals, and they were taught to speak. The elementals natuaraly were drawn to where they had come from, and so they returned there. Tilo took to the deepest depths of the Seas, and from this darkness that was much like the Darkness, the primodial beings were formed. They were taught to speak, and stayed in the deep seas, as they preferred the darkness. But none of these were what Tilo had seen in the dream.

## Tilo's Slumber, and the Birth of the First Races

Tilo thought "there are now many things. They think and create like I did and like Ith and Ool did before me," and was happy. Tilo decided that there was nothing left that needed to be done, so Tilo rested. After 12 days, Tilo still slept, but Io and Oi did not worry. After 48 days, Tilo still slept, but Io and Oi did not worry. On the 60th day, Thres came to Io and Oi and said "Tilo has slept for many days and nights. Will Tilo wake again?" Io and Oi smiled, then Io, being the first of the two created and very knowledgable on the history of Everything, told Thres the story of how Tilo came to be. Thres listened and pondered. Finally, after much thought, Thres said "if Ith and Ool created Tilo, and Tilo created us, what are we to do?" Oi, often thinking long into the future, said "We too shall create like Ith and Ool and Tilo did. We shall create many things, and you shall too." After Oi said that, Tilo sighed, and still deeply asleep, smiled. With that, Tilo disappeared, and the knowledge that had yet to be shared by Tilo spread far and wide into the world, creating all sorts of things. The planes were created, the small creatures were created, the dumb beasts were created, and the first races were created. Thres smiled, understanding that Tilo had finally created what they had seen in their dream. Io and Oi decided to take to the sky to watch over the world as Tilo once had, entrusting Thres to teach this new life like Tilo once had. Tilo had finally gone to rest, and Io, Oi and Thres smilled. And it was good.
