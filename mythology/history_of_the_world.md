This is a compiled and condenced version of world history as told by various bards from the many nations of old. This history was written down after a meeting of the many nations.

## The Creation of First Nations

The first of the members of the many nations were created from the knowledge of an old god. As they first emerged, a great enemy appeared before them; A terrible Ent that stood 50 men high. Working together, the memebers of the many nations brought forth all of their might and slayed the great beast. This was the first of the many times the members cooperated.

## The Founding of the First Nations

After many years, the first of many nations started to form. In the plains, the Gnomes weaved their first towns together out of the long grasses. The elves took to the trees of the oldest forests to carve for themselves. The Dwarves cut through the rocks for the Orc and Dragonborn, then dug deep to cut out towns for themselves. The halflings and humans settled many places.

## The First Many Nations War

Years of peace brought about the lives of excess and wealth that fueled greed, distrust, and hatred among the many nations. The nations took to wanting what they did not have and flaunting what they did. Although few went hungry, they were starved. varying accounts occur on who started the First Many Nations War, but what is known, is that the Gnomes Halflings and Elves took up lots together, the Dwarves Orcs and Dragonborn took up lots together, and the Humans took up lots with whoever paid the most. Around this time, Teiflings appeared. Noone could say for sure when they appeared, but they were known thoughout as mighty warriors, and they took no sides. On the 12th year of warring, Halsbar of the Human nation of Grath took to organizing the many nations of Humans. Once under his rule, Halsbar went with his many armies and generals, well paid and hardened by the many years of warring, and brought a violent peace to the land. Most regard Halsbar as a soldier of fotune that simply took the best bet on lining his pockets, but all agree that after the Seige of Uuunlioj, the last of the many nations laid their swords to rest, and talks of peace could begin. 

On the 10th day of the 15th month of the 12th year of the First Many Nations War, each of the many nations was summoned to Grath to negotiate a long standing peace. For this occasion, a grand hall was constructed so that the many nations could sit together. In the center of this hall, an oak tree stood firm, reminding those who attended of their history and cooperation many years ago. Halsbar took to the stage first, proclaiming himself emperor of the Humans, and banishing all delagates from those nations. This caused an uproar, but the delagates from those nations left with heads bowed. Then, the Orc delegates took to the stage. They had seen their countrymen bare the main weight of fighting. These delegates demanded the remains of their countrymen so that they could be put to rest honorably. The many delegates agreed, and so went out the decree for all Orcs to be returned to their homelands safely. Next the Dragonborn took to the stage, and thanked the Dwarves and Orcs for their honorable sacifies in the war. Those delegates applauded, and the Dragonborn returned to where they sat, saying nothing more. Next, the Dwarves took to the stage, and thanked the Dragonborn and Orc, as they had relied on them very much during the war. The Dwarves then thanked Halsbar, noting his cunning and bravery as the tools necessary to end the war, and they returned to where they sat. Next were the Elves. The Elves too thanked Halsbar for ending the war, and then thanked the Gnomes and Halflings. Next the Gnomes came, and they too thanked their compatriots. Next came the Halflings, led by Jrith the Foolish, who was known as Jrith War Eagle at the time. Jrith took to the stage in front of all other Delegates of the Halflings, and proclaimed themselves Emperor of the Halflings. The other delegates of the Halflings erupted in cheers, and so too did the delegates of the other nations. Finally, the Teiflings took to the stage. There were three in total, which was of much interest, as there seemed to be many Teifling. The Teifling delegates asked for land past Ghu'vo in the Great Forest so that they could form their Nations, and the other delegates agreed. 

This marked the end of the First Many Nations War.

## The Time of Rest

After the First Many Nations War, war broke out among the Humans, as most hand come to resent Halsbar. However, the war was again ended swiftly by Halsbar, and his reign seemed inevitable, if not for his sudden death during his celebrations, in which he was poisoned by his commanders. His body was destroyed, and in his place, his commanders sent notice to all towns and cities and villages that they were to govern themselves as they saw fit. 

4 years after the death of Halsbar, Jrith the Foolish, who at this time was known as Jrith Golden War Eagle, called to the other nations to organize a new meeting, and so it was set in motion. On the day that was specified in the City of Uujil, the nations again met together under the stoic branches of an old oak tree, and discussed the goings on of their nations. The delegates agreed by the end of the meeting that there should be a meeting of this sort every 6th year, and so it was, with each nation agreeing to take turns hosting in accordance with order of the first meeting, starting with the Orc. This tradition still occured at the time of this writing, roughly 300 generations later.

## The Second Many Nations War

After the Death of Illonius, Third Son of the Sun, Hero of the Northern Forest, Slayer of The Horrible Ooglitho'ihat, first of the Stonemen, the nations gathered together to mourn. On the 4th night of morning, before the funeral pyre was set but after Illonius's body had been anointed and cast in Bronze, a huge golem appeared. The golem was said to be too tall to see the face, and so wide that it blocked out the moon. This golem destroyed the entire city of Harik, before setting off and destroying Grath, Uuhilo, and the many other capital cities. Eventually, the golem walked into the sea, and never was seen again.

With the capital cities gone, along with most of their goverments, the many nations were thrown into chaos, and eventually war broke out. This war lasted for 35 years, and the nations were reduced to piles of ash by its end. Before all had been lost, Skreebnish the Wise united enough of the peoples of many lands and brokered peace. This led to the third significant meeting of many nations, in which Skreebnish and the remaining Teiflings declared their interest in helping the other nations rebuild. Other than minor squabbles, this meeting concluded with the declaration of the end of the Second Many Nations War.

## Skreebish the Wise, and the Great Rebuilding

At this time, after the remnants of the nations had settled down and agreed to ending the war, Skreebish first set off back to the town of Shiirbew to his home and began rebuilding. At this time, some elves that had lived in a neighboring village approached Shiirbew and petitioned to join the town. Skreebish, sensing the potential to foster new bonds, welcomed them in with open arms, and the town began to prosper through the combination of the many traditions of the two peoples. Skreebish recorded these findings, and presented them at the next Meeting of the Many Nations. Many delegates had come to know these results for themselves as many had noticed similar occurances in their towns and villages. And so it came to be that the many races that had up until this time mostly lived with themselves, decided that there could be a bennifit to opening their doors to others. So began the Great Rebuilding, in which the sharing of ideas, teachings, and blending of peoples created new Nations on stronger foundations than even before the First Many Nations War.

## The Reckoning of Oab

In the 6th year of the Great Rebuilding, during the colder months, there became reports of towns disappearing. Eventually, Skreebish set off with some trusted advisors to investigate these reports. After three towns were visited, Skreebish confirmed that the towns had indeed gone missing, or rather, ceased to exist. Where they once stood, simply a deep pit whos bottom could not be seen. When Skreebish returned to his home, he consulted with the elders of the town, and when they could not recall a thing similar to this event, Skreebish summoned the great warriors of the land and instructed them to be on guard for some great terrible beast. But Skreebish had been mistaken, this was not the work of some colossal evil, but of Oab. Oab, daughter of the Ents, Tyrant of the gold dragons, and the Great Warlock of the Unknown One.

## Oab, the Great Destroyer

Oab made herself known in the last year of the Great Rebuilding. Thinking Oab was a simple priestess, Skreebish let her approach when they by chance met in the town of Gruywa. Oab knew of Skreebish, called the Wise, and as she approached, she asked "when are we blindest?" Skreebish pondered for a moment, but had no answer. Intrigued, he asked for the answer. Oab asked for Skreebish's hand, as was a traditional greeting of the Teiflings, and once Oab had firmly grasped his hand, she drew him close to her and into her dagger that she had concealed. With a whisper, Oab told Skreebish the answer to her riddle: "when we think we are safe". As the light drained from Skreebish's eyes, Oab cast away his body and cast many spells, destroying all life in the town and most of the buildings. The only thing left of Gruywa was a single post of the inn, Skreebish's body, and unknown to Oab, a single dwarf, Griff, too young to be seen behind the post of the inn. Oab was too weak from her display, and fled to a safe place to rest and recover. Griff ran from her hiding place and approached Skreebish. Skreebish, in his last breath, told Griff to deliver this world a safeness and peace that Skreebish could not, and died. The funeral of Skreebish lasted 40 days.

## The Dark Years

After the death of Skreebish, Oab roamed freely, and left nothing behind as she passed through. The world was scortched in her wake, and her power grew with each town and village destroyed. Griff took to the mountains to find her people, and began to train. The world, on the verge of greatness, had been cast into confusion and chaos. The people withdrew into their villages and fortified them. The people armed themselves and feared what was beyond their lands. Oab hunted these towns for sport, and the cruelty shown was too horrible to record in these pages. 


---
## The Last Days

Many years had passed, and Griff had finally become strong enough to lead the troops of the Dwarves. And so they set off, casting away the fear that plagued the lands. Each day they traveled into a new village or town and recruited more to the holy cause. Each day, the end of Oab drew closer. Finally, as the sun set on the 5th day of the 10th month of the 3rd year, Griff had cornered Oab in the Dark Horse Pass just beyond the sun-dried plains of the Red Forest. Griff and ehr army, said to be over a hundred thousand warriors strong, had completely surrounded Oab, and the ring they formed was at least 300 men deep. Griff approached Oab, and proclaimed: "Now is the time for you to be destroyed, and the curses you brought to these lands shall be no more." Griff was confident, as she knew each warrior with her was prepared to die to rid the world of this evil. Griff did not see any of them die, as she was the first killed. Oab summoned all the hellish beasts known and many that hand't been known before the battle. The beasts were vile creatures, led by a horrible host of death and rot, and the dirt rocked underneath the fighting. For 2 days, the battle raged on, as the pass had been sealed off on both sides to ensure that it was a fight to the death. On the second day, as the sun set, Oab was exausted, but still fought. On the 3rd day, there was still no rest, on the 5th day, warriors were dying from the remaining beasts and exaustion. On the 7th day, Oab was killed, and the beasts vanished. There were 513 warriors of Griff left. But the world signed, and knew peace. This battle became known as The Last Days, because for far too many, they had been.

## The Eventual Death 

Too many had died, and what was left was too few. there was not enough for peace, there were too few to build, and the world began to die. After 30 years, there were less than 10 villages. At this point, the leaders of the last villages came together in the place where the bards told these stories to me, a simple scribe. After we had written down these stories, the elders decided to conviene. After they had been together for a few days, the elders told us "we will not live forever," and so myself, the bards, and the elders, and the village leaders came together and thought of what to do. Many days later, the elders entered a deep trance. Days later, the elders emerged, and had decided that we had no chance ourselves to live, but that we could pass on what we had learned. I had been nominated to teach whatever the elders create. The village leaders went back to their villages. The elders and bards disappeared into the great hall. I decided after the 3rd day that I should sleep, as the elders would wake me.
