                <h3 class="chapter-head">The Beginning</h3>
                <p>The first things that our ancestors saw, was a dark room with many strange objects, and the faint glow at the end of a tunnel. They knew not who they were, where they stood, or what it meant. Following the light, there was laying in the Sun what became known to us as a Gnome. The Gnome woke, and looking at us with a puzzled face, spoke. We could not answer with our voices. The Gnome, after a moment, entered the cave for many moments, and then emerged, and looked at us. Then, the Gnome set about teaching us to speak.</p>
                <p>It took many days and nights before we could speak, but we did learn, and we did speak. We were told our names, and the Gnome's name, but none remembered. We asked the Gnome if they created us, and the Gnome told us "no, you were created many times before, but now you can think for yourselves and speak for yourselves." We asked the Gnome if they ruled this land, and the Gnome told us "no, no one rules this land any more. Many have, and many probably will, but none rule this land." Then we asked the Gnome if there were many like them, and the Gnome said "there were many like me, and many that were different. Now there are not, because of fear and greed." We then learned all that had happened before we thought for ourselves and spoke our own words, and learned of the terrible fates of others, and the joy that had been taken. We asked the Gnome what we should do, and the Gnome said "learn to live together and to trust. Learn to love and not to fear eachother. Build your villages together, and never let what you are keep you from others." And so we did. The few became many, and they left. Those many became more, and built more villages and towns and cities and nations. These were not nations of race, but nations built on ideas on how the world should be. These nations were the beginning.</p>

                <h3 class="chapter-head">The Discoveries</h3>
                <p>There was a Turtle named Oobenth from the Village Gro who was a trained scout for the people of the village. On a longer journey, Oobenth traversed deep into the mountains, and discovered the Village of Dwarves. These were creatures that noone had met before, so Oobenth was cautious, but approached. The Dwarves were astonished by Oobenth's words, and told him that they were a people much like the Gnomes. Oobenth was confused, as there had been only one Gnome, but much to his supprise, the Dwarves explained that there were Gnome villages still standing. The old races still had settlements, but they were deeply hidden in the wild parts of the world. Oobenth asked where these villages were, but the Dwarves could not say. They did not talk with those villages, and so they did not know.</p>
                <p>Oobenth returned to Gro and informed the elders of his discovery. The elders, thinking it was a trick, sent out two more with Oobenth to confirm the village of Dwarves, and they did. The Dwarves were too far away to trade with, as the pass was much too difficult to navigate with wagon, but the Dwarves did give the party a book on metal working. The village of Gro took this metal working knowledge and learned to harness the hardstone into bronze and iron. And they waged wars of conquests, eventually creating the Guroo Empire. Though the Empire fell shortly, the discovery of the old races and metal working spread quickly through the villages.</p>

                <h3 class="chapter-head">Firsts</h3>
                <p>The nations rose and fell mostly through wheat famines and strong leaders. Generations later, there were a few strong nations that leanred enough on their own to stand through the worst of the world. These nations gathered their strongest fighters and attempted to claim as much territory as possible. Though these nations too eventually fell, the cultures they spread left marks in the world that couldn't be erased by time, just softened. Thus, the first cultures were made and established, and forgotten.</p>
                <p>The next nations took what they had and expanded on it. These nations gained the ideas of the old and took new ideas from their people and made something new. These were the Second Cultures, the nations before the current world. Second Cultures were larger than the nations of today, but smaller than the first group. The last of these cultures were only lost after the Great Ga'laath uleashed the young tarrasque Ij to free those that were inslaved.</p>

                <h3 class="chapter-head">The Beginning of This Age</h3>
                <p>Tarrasques brought about the world of today, but not quickly. 500 years or so after their summoning, the last was bannished. 10 generations after, the villages we know today were finally established. We took what we had left from those that came before us, and decided to rebuild and keep going. We hide behind our walls in the hopes that our traders navigate the ancient roads through the untamed forests, but each trip is never a guarantee. We must wonder if the old races are still alive or if our choices finally wrote their last pages. We must question what it means that we still go on.</p>
