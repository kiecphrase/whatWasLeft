                <h3 class="category">Foods</h3>
                <p>Corn and Potatoes are staple vegetables. Corn was the first revived domesticated crop, and there is a lot of cultural significance surrounding Corn.</p>
                <p>Meat is less significant in the standard diet, fish is common on the coasts, and wild game is common in the wooded settlements. Some animals have been "domesticated", but they are mainly used for other purposes and not meat. The only widely domesticated animal specifically for meat is the chikpea, a small green bird that is semi-flightless. The birds and the eggs are commonly consumed.</p>
                <p>Grains are very significant in the common diet. By accident, a semi-arid type of grain cross-pollinated with a quickly sprouting grain to create a fairly drought resistant crop that can be harvested multiple times in the warm months.</p>
                <p>Fruits have been significantly domesticated and managed. From them, a veriety of alcohols have been produced.</p>

                <h3 class="category">Culture and Society</h3>
                <p>At this point, most societies are single villages or One larger fortress with small villages surrounding them. There are many of these small villages.</p>
                <p>These societies are dotted around the major continents with significant distance between them. However, trade is extremely common and some societies practice semi-nomadic traditions.</p>
                <p>Most societies are quasi-agrarian, with a craftmen class and warrior class being also prevalent in most societies.</p>
                <p>Govenrments are extremely varried. Democracies exist, but many societies are ruled monarchally or oligarchally, and some follow a "strong-man leads" system in which the chief is chief as long as noone can best them in some measured capacity.</p>

                <h3 class="category">Religion</h3>
                <p>Religion is both nearly omnipresent and nonexistent; there is no unifying organized religion, but there is a common belief that many things house spirits and "gods". These deities typically are specific to locations, and there can be many nearly identical deities.</p>
                <p>Most people pray to some "god", generally one directly related to their profession. Ancestors are also prayed to for guidance and to watch over surviving members of families.</p>
                <p>A vast majority of people are spiritual, and those that are not at least acknowledge that the spirits do exist but simply choose not to seek divine intervention from them.</p>
