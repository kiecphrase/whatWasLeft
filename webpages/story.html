                <h5>In the beginning, we were nothing. There were many like us, and we did not stand on our own. Ours was simply existence, and we attempted to thrive.</h5>
                <p>We met a wizard who asked us a favor. Could we please help protect them? What we did was what we thought was right.</p>
                <p>A village was trapped and needed someone to assist. There were many paths we could have chosen, but in the end we picked just one.</p>
                <p>We found a tired farmer, alone in his field. He seemed content with the sunrise, but beckoned us over to have a chat.</p>
